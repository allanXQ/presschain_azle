## Technical Overview

### Backend

The backend is built using **Azle**, a TypeScript framework for the Internet Computer which compiles to Motoko. It defines the business logic and data management handled by canisters deployed on the ICP network.

### Canisters

- **Journalist Canister:** Handles operations related to user management (registration, updates, deletion) and article management (submission, retrieval).

### Frontend

The frontend is built using **React** and **Material-UI**, providing a responsive user interface for interacting with the backend services deployed on the ICP.

- **React:** Manages the UI components and user interactions.
- **Material-UI:** Used for designing a polished material-themed user interface.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **DFINITY Canister SDK:** Required to build and deploy canisters.
- **Node.js:** Required to run the frontend application.
- **NPM:** Recommended for managing JavaScript dependencies.

### Installation

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-repository/journalist-platform.git
cd journalist-platform
```

#### Set up the Backend
